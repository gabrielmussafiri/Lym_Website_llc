              <p className="text-muted-foreground dark:text-white mb-4">
                Via Comply was founded in 2018 by a team of security and
                compliance experts who saw a gap in the market: growing
                companies needed to achieve compliance with industry standards
                like SOC 2 and ISO 27001, but traditional consulting approaches
                were too complex, time-consuming, and expensive.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground dark:text-white mb-4">
                We set out to create a more efficient, practical approach to
                complianceâ€”one that would help startups and growing companies
                achieve their compliance goals without unnecessary complexity or
                overhead.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground dark:text-white">
                Today, we've helped over 100 companies across various industries
                achieve compliance with standards like SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA,
                and more. Our team has grown, but our mission remains the same:
                to simplify compliance for growing companies.
