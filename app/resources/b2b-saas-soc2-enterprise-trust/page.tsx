          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Why SOC 2 Matters Now More Than Ever</h3>
          <p className="mb-6">
            In today's SaaS economy, enterprise buyers don't just buy features ‚Äî they buy trust. And for many, that trust starts with a SOC 2 report.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            SOC 2 has become the industry standard for demonstrating that your systems are secure, your practices are auditable, and your company is serious about protecting customer data. It covers five trust principles ‚Äî security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy ‚Äî with the Security principle being the core of most Type I and II audits.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Whether you're automating workflows or processing sensitive data, your ability to prove governance is now a growth lever ‚Äî not just a risk mitigator.
          </p>
          <div className="my-8 border-t border-border" />
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">What It Takes to Move Fast Without Breaking Integrity</h3>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Contrary to popular belief, SOC 2 Type I doesn't need to be a 6‚Äì12 month initiative. With the right structure and alignment, many B2B SaaS startups can complete a credible, audit-ready program in 8‚Äì12 weeks.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">Here's what that journey typically looks like when done right:</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4 mb-8">
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">üõ† 1. Gap Assessment</span><br />
              Understand what controls are already in place and what's missing ‚Äî across cloud architecture, policies, and vendor management.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">üßæ 2. Policy & Control Rollout</span><br />
              Roll out practical, lightweight policies tailored to your environment ‚Äî such as access management, change control, and incident response ‚Äî and implement the associated controls.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">üìÅ 3. Evidence & Documentation</span><br />
              Build out repeatable workflows to collect audit evidence. Where possible, leverage automation from tools you already use (e.g., AWS, GitHub, Okta, Jira).
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">üéØ 4. Audit Readiness & Coaching</span><br />
              Train control owners, run mock walkthroughs, and align with auditors on expectations. Documentation should reflect operational reality ‚Äî not just boilerplate.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">What Teams Often Get Wrong</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-8">
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Waiting for sales pressure to act</span><br />SOC 2 done reactively leads to rushed, fragile implementations.</li>
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Treating it as a one-time checkbox</span><br />Successful programs embed controls into how the company works ‚Äî and scale with growth.</li>
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Overengineering the solution</span><br />Startups don't need an enterprise GRC tool out of the gate. Simplicity scales better than complexity.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-6">
            The key is to treat SOC 2 as the first iteration of your security maturity journey, not the end state.
          </p>
          <div className="my-8 border-t border-border" />
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Certification Is Just the Beginning</h3>
          <p className="mb-6">
            A clean SOC 2 Type I signals that your controls are well-designed. Type II proves they're operating over time. Together, they serve as powerful trust signals for:

            <li>Future acquirers and partners</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-6">
            And most importantly, they create internal discipline ‚Äî from engineering to ops ‚Äî around how data and systems are managed securely.

            SOC 2 is not just about compliance ‚Äî it's about credibility. And speed matters.
